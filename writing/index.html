<h1><center>The Green Knight (2021) - David Lowery</center></h1>
 
<p style="text-indent:30px;"><i>The Green Knight</i> is a most interesting movie as it illustrates the question of the access to knighthood in times of comfort.
  This is a particularly compelling subject as I find that it resonates with our current times: Western modern societies have indeed gathered countless resources, 
  and yet seem to be subject to a now deeper wound, a spiritual hollowness. The historical setting of the <i>The Green Knight</i>  is thus ideal to go and examine the 
  answer of the knights to the issue of idleness.
  <p>My point is the following: the “domination of nature” through agriculture ensures a <b>physical sustenance</b> to humans – but deprives
  them of the <b>spiritual sustenance</b> of the hunting-gathering activity. Nature  is, temporarily, tamed. And yet it appears that something greater was at play in our battle. We come to
  understand that we needed the adversary we vanquished for the challenge it offered us.</p>

<p>The movie opens with a shot of cattle, anchoring the movie in one of the societal changes that is at the root of Gawain’s struggle. Hunting as a prime source of food
  has disappeared, and with it a great opportunity for youths to show their valour to the community.  Gawain’s progression cannot either occur through war since the 
  Saxons have been vanquished by the warriors. The absence of quest engenders idleness, a void, which vice is quick to occupy.</p>

<p>Fortunately the Green Knight is summoned, and offers a quest – a Game – which can save Gawain. The Game consists of a series of challenges, 
  which, interestingly, become more and more internal. The first challenge is a beheading, but the fourth one is a hidden one: the testing of one’s virtue
  in the private, resting realm. The ultimate test is the severing of the maternal bond, and the acceptance of death.</p>

<p>What is fascinating in Gawain’s story is how he is saved by a Game. Isn’t it surprising that a mere Game could make him holy? And yet that is
  what happens. To me, this hints at something interesting. We undertake Games when boredom strikes, on an endless sunday afternoon for instance.
  They are, in a way, an artificial challenge, a place to expand the surplus of energy that
  results from having relinquished a great part of our survival work to technology.</p>
      <p> I thus argue that modern boredom can be cured by the reinvention
  of life as a Game, that is the creation of risky challenges of our own that might become tales.
  This becomes the way of transcending the curse associated with the blessing of technology.
  The redeeming quality of the Game is in the fact that we can choose to undertake it, where survival is forced. It is in this new choice of the allocation
  of our energy that we find the exertion of freedom. What emerges, in the choice to put our life “back on the table”, is a splendid disregard of death,
  a playfulness akin to the one of the Lord who actualises his knighthood daily in the pursuit of “Game”.</p>
  <p>In the end, all seems to be contained in the
  “Green”: to accept death is to blossom.</p>
      
<h1><center>Have a Nice Day (2017) - Liu Jian</center></h1>
<p style="text-indent:30px;"><i>Have a Nice Day</i> is a remarkable animated movie. A deeply symbolic film, it can be argued 
  that it is a metamodern work. What is metamodernism? It is a synthesis of the hope of modernism combined with the rational skepticism of postmodernism.</p>

<p>The film has all the aspects of a black humor piece: absurd deaths, irony. The characters die for no reason in the pursuit of a bag of money.</p>

<p>What is fascinating about <i>Have a Nice Day</i> is that it goes further than the “now-traditional” cynicism of postmodern black humor.
  The characters are deeply humanized as they are allowed to express their dreams. Whether it is through small talk or images in one's bedroom, 
  we come to understand the character's motives. They are not idiots or greedy fools, but people with dreams that have resorted to a criminal
  way of achieving them. Their faces are neither ugly nor beautiful, not good nor bad.</p>

<p>In contrast, there is a strong criticism of the two other sides of the coin: modernism and postmodernism, which happens through a reflection
  on people's faces. Modernism wants faces to be ideal, perfect, and is the cause of the missed operation of the protagonist's girlfriend, which
  starts the whole massacre. On the other hand, the painter, a fauvist, draws faces as extremely ugly and thinks that people are "fools” or "idiots".
  One character in the main painting has his finger pointed towards his head, hinting at suicide. The painter's character embodies a cynicism that has
  become dismissive of all values, including friendship. I argue that the stripping and beating of the painter is metaphorical: it is the idea of cynicism 
  that is being incarnated here and destroyed, in some sort of artistic catharsis, just like in a Tarantino movie.</p>

<p>The movie opens with a quote from Tolstoï’s <i>Resurrection</i>: under the dirty pavement of the city, there is a spring. Can we excavate the dream
  under the nihilist layer?</p>
