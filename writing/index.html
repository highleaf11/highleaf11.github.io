 <center><h1>The Green Knight (2021) - David Lowery</h1></center>
    <p style="text-indent:30px;">
        I thoroughly enjoyed the Green Knight for its ominous atmosphere and the beauty of its symbolism. The movie is remarkable for its innovation in the illustration of the accession to Knighthood.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gawain, nephew to the king, must undertake a challenge, a Game, to become a knight. To succeed, he has to pass several tests, which become more and more difficult.</P>
      <p>What is interesting in the gradation of the challenges is that they start as physical ones, and more and more become internal. The first challenge is to behead the Green Knight and the second one is the scavenger's. Afterwards things become more complicated. To me, the third challenge, with St Winifred, is actually about the reconnection of Gawain's own head to his body. It is at this moment that he obtains a correct "fitness" to undertake the rest of his quest. This is marked by the apparition of the fox, which might represent his consciousness. The fourth challenge is a hidden one: it is about the testing of one's virtue in the private realm. The fifth challenge is also very interesting: Gawain must reject his former ally, a consciousness that would like to keep him from achieving his goal. The last challenge is about the acceptance of death: the maternal enchanted belt is the last mark of a deathless comfort that must be relinquished. It is only by going "all-in" in the Game that Gawain can become a Knight, a truly honourable fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
        The twist with this heroic story is in the humanisation of the character, who fails a great number of tests, and nonetheless is able to become a knight. This take is quite different from the Greek hero of divine ascendance for instance, who has his success already written in his blood. The chain of failures and successes also illustrates the non-linear nature of growth, which comes through a series of progressions and regressions. It is, in a way akin to the period after Christmas: winter is ever-cold and yet each day the light steadily progresses, as if, under the weather, spring was already in preparation.

      <center><h1>Quelques réflexions sur "El espíritu de la colmena" (1973).</h1></center>
    <p style="text-indent:30px;">
       J'ai eu le privilège de découvrir cet excellent film grâce à la recommandation de Roger Ebert, qui l'a inclus dans sa liste de "Great movies". 

    <p>
       Plonger purement dans l'imagination morbide et sans limite de l'enfance - je ne pensais pas qu'il soit possible d'atteindre avec tant de précision ces jeux cachés et pervers que recèlent cet âge. Le fait que les protagonistes soient des filles peut nous amner à penser aux évenements du Polteirgeist d'Enfield. Quand Lucie figure sa mort afin d'effrayer Ana, il y a quelque chose de perturbant: peut-on aller aussi loin? La réponse est oui! C'est ce caractère d'engagement total, du "toujours-plus" du jeu morbide de l'enfant qui est mis en lumière ici. Nous n'imaginions pas qu'une force d'esprit aussi puissante puisse être mobilisée par ces jeunes êtres, mais c'est le cas, ils ont déjà en eux le corps et âme de l'art total. 
</P>
      <p>Deuxième point intéressant, une sorte de voyage dans l'histoire du cinéma et dans le rejeu d'une scène emblématique: celle de la battue de campagne à la recherche de l'enfant disparu. Cette scène est puissante et rend hommage à son ancêtre dans le film Frankenstein (1931). Ce moment m'a rappelé l'extraordinaire homologue de cette scène qu'on trouve dans Loveless d'Andrey Zvyagintsev, comprenant ainsi une partie de ses origines, mais ayant en tête les variations que cette scène plus contemporaine propose. 

    </p>
    <p>
        Enfin, j'ai trouvé intéressante la métaphore de la ruche et de l'abeille. De ce que je comprends, l'abeille est ici symbole du travailleur sans âme aliéné par le régime Franquiste. Pourtant chez Francis Bacon, l'abeille est animal de synthèse suprême, entre la fourmi et l'araignée. De nos jours-même, l'abeille est fort appréciée, elle est, en tant que butineuse, le maillon magique de la croissance végétale. Ainsi, cette vision péjorative de l'abeille dans le film nous permet de re-réfléchir à la manière dont nous "humanisons" le réel et y mettons ce que nous voulons.

     <center><h1>Bacurau (2019)</h1></center>
    <p style="text-indent:30px;">
    What is remarkable about the movie is how it switches from what appears to be a dramatic start to 
a theatrical ending - there is a switch in tone. 
At first we think that the story will be about power struggles in the village after the 
death of the elder one. But then comes an humanus ex machina: crazy nazis want to destroy the village for fun.
Here the village shifts: it reveals the violence laying under its peasible looks - the weapons in the museum.
    </p>  
    <p>
     From a drama, the story switches to the theatrical hunt of the nazis. By theatrical I mean that the spectator 
rapidly understands that the nazis are bound to be vanquished, and that the pleasure will come from the 
castigation of the idiots. 
The village becomes a heroic un-vanquishable force - and as such the movie some sort
of counter-propaganda piece.
It is as if south america was turning the weapons of cultural violence against its oppressors.
You want war? Well there it is. We had the weapons in the museum.
For theatrical movies are a form of violence (they negate the uncertainty of reality) - the movie says, well
if you really want us to use that violence in the cultural realm, then we will do it, we will fight with weapons.
So there it is. This movie is a lizard that was sleeping in the sun, now fighting will all its teeth against its agressor.

      <center> <h1>Azor (2017) - Andreas Fontana</h1></center>
    <p style="text-indent:30px;">
        <i>Azor</i> is a film you will enjoy for its superb economy of means. Through its use 
      of symbolism and its theatrical structure it gives the spectator plenty of room to be active 
      in filling the blanks it leaves open. Its economical refinement is both visually and intellectually beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movie is set during the bloody 1976-83 Argentine dictatorship. It is the story of a Swiss banker
      arriving in Argentina to look for his missing business partner. </p
      <p>
      The film is about the process of corruption of a 'neutral' man - replaying the
      topos of the corrupting colonies, one could read about in Conrad's work for instance.
      Initial 'neutrality' of the character is signified by the fact that he does not drink alcohol - 
      while his wife drinks tea (the strategic drink of the masters of corruption), and the crooks drink alcohol. At the beginning, the purity of his mineral water is untouched. But as he comes closer to corruption,
      he starts touching it: a drink of gin is proposed to him, he shakes the hand of a man that has recently urinated. 
      Finally he concludes a deal with a man whose name is 'manchado', which literally translates as 'soiled' in English : the corruption is complete.
    </p>
    <p>
        The symbolism is such that the movie has theatrical nature to it, in the sense that it
      tries less than other movies to give the illusion of the real. The movie seems to operate in acts
      and scenes - in places which hold deep symbolic power - and that are more and more corrupted : the gala,
      the circle of arms, and finally the jungle - place of fascism itself. This reminded me of Moliere's <i>Dom Juan</i>, 
      where the protagonist is led closer and closer to the moment of reckoning until the end. There is a gradation,
      a progression in these loci. I found in this movie, the elegant and rigid form of theater, as some sort of self imposed rule that magnifies the beauty of its story.
    </p>
    <p>
        The final shot of the movie is hauntingly great. The expression of triumphal guilt. The neutral swiss turned into a dostoïevskian wretch.
    </p>

    



<h1><center>Have a Nice Day (2017) - Liu Jian</center></h1>
<p style="text-indent:30px;"><i>Have a Nice Day</i> is a remarkable animated movie. A deeply symbolic film, it can be argued 
  that it is a metamodern work. What is metamodernism? It is a synthesis of the hope of modernism and the skepticism of postmodernism.</p>

<p>
  In <i>Have a Nice Day</i> a flurry of characters vye for a stolen bag of money in a Chinese town, often to their demise.
  The film has all the aspects of a black humor piece: absurd deaths, irony.</p>

<p>What is fascinating about <i>Have a Nice Day</i> is that it goes further than the “now-traditional” cynicism of postmodern black humor.
  The characters are deeply humanized as they are allowed to express their dreams. Whether it is through small talk or images in one's bedroom, 
  we come to understand the character's motives. They are not idiots or greedy fools, but people with dreams that have resorted to a criminal
  way of achieving them. Their faces are neither ugly nor beautiful, not good nor bad.</p>

<p>In contrast, there is a strong criticism of the two other sides of the coin: modernism and postmodernism, which happens through a reflection
  on people's faces. Modernism wants faces to be ideal, perfect, and is the cause of the missed operation of the protagonist's girlfriend, which
  starts the whole massacre. On the other hand, the painter, a fauvist, draws faces as extremely ugly and thinks that people are "fools” or "idiots".
  One character in the main painting has his finger pointed towards his head, hinting at suicide. The painter's character embodies a cynicism that has
  become dismissive of all values, including friendship. I argue that the stripping and beating of the painter is metaphorical: it is the idea of cynicism 
  that is being incarnated here and destroyed, in some sort of artistic catharsis, just like in a Tarantino movie.</p>

<p>The movie opens with a quote from Tolstoï’s <i>Resurrection</i>: under the dirty pavement of the city, there is a spring. Can we excavate the dream
  under the nihilist layer?</p>
