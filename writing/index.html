      Ivan Illitch chose a wife that was both a joy to him and to society (at least in the beginning).

      The true bottleneck and vacillation of life is the will to live, which seems to have as non-unique condition the "other" as the witness of the dignity of our story. 
      In this regard, "a community of one's own" could be seen as a necessity for mental stability.

      As Camus said, the only question that exists is the one of suicide. I agree and add: We can be dead spiritually even though we are physically alive. This can happen wittingly or unwittingly. To be a living-dead is 
      to refuse to live and to refuse suicide, that is to be in limbo. That state solidifies with time, but has liquidity.

      For book search, physical tasting of a limited curated list of random options seems vastly superior to any sort of conceptual approach.
      Randomness is suitable as it makes it possible to find what we were not looking for.

      The hiking experience is useful as a metaphor of work.

      Video gaming is working in a coherent world. It is a potential substitute
      product for the decrease in work required by employment due to the advancement of technology in our incoherent world, hence its growth?
      It is a sort of womb-like coherent copium.

      Virginia Woolf thought at 38 "Everything that I might write,
       Mr. Joyce is probably doing it better now."

      "Brusquement, mon travail en restait là; je me rappelai l'incapacité où je m'étais trouvé de fixer
      mon esprit, ce matin d'il y avait à peine un mois, et avec quel plaisir je m'étais interrompu pour aller
      recevoir la Daily Chronicle des mains du petit porteur de journaux."

      I define the following categories of how we spend our time:
      <br>Employment (public constraint)
      <br>Personal work (private constraint)
      <br>Social leasure (public freedom)
      <br>Spite (private freedom)
      </p>

      It is said that 4 items is what standard mind can hold in RAM at a time. This is a maximum.
      3 is suitable as we have one space left in case we need it, just as we have two kidneys for security.

      The place of exposition matters: it contaminates the opus.

      The Greeks valued the power of the spoken word, and it was their main method of communication 
      and storytelling. Bahn and Bahn write, "To Greeks the spoken word was a living thing and infinitely
      preferable to the dead symbols of a written language." Socrates himself believed that once
      something has been written down, it lost its ability for change and growth. For these reasons,
      among many others, oral storytelling flourished in Greece. (from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_ancient_Greece)
