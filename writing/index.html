    The Simone exhortation scene in the French Dispatch
I watched the French Dispatch yesterday and was moved by the scene in which Simone exhorts the painter to go on with his art.
      It seemed to me that in the middle of the movie's joyful atmosphere this particular scene addressed a more dramatic dimension of life. 
Simeone stares intently at the camera and orders us to carry on with the work we have, and says that after pain and pain,
      and pain again, things will get better - and that, whatever talent we have, they are not shared by everyone, and that we should put them to use.
      There is no discussion to be had. It is an order of the pristine guardian that will not accept our disparition.
It warmed my heart to receive this grave message, born from the experience of pain of the creator - encouraging others, humanity,
      to tread the difficult paths. It feels to me a pathetic message of hope, that in spite of our proud reluctancy, we may very well need.
The editor's office is a no crying zone. With success in the mission of entertainment, the other parts of the movie take us to a
      place where death is painless and mass fights are animated paintings. The movie itself becomes a no crying zone,
      sheltering us from whatever current troubles our life may hold. For me, the Simone scene is perhaps the dramatic counterpoint
      holding the dreamlike structure together. Let us have some fun, but let me tell you also that this fun was not created without pain,
      that pain exists - and that it can be endured to create magic.
