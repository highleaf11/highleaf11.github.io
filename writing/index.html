<h1><center>The Green Knight (2021)</center></h1>
 
<p style="text-indent:30px;"><i>The Green Knight</i> is a most interesting movie as it illustrates the question of the access to knighthood in times of abundance. This is a particularly compelling question as I find that it resonates with our current times: Western modern societies have indeed gathered countless resources, and yet seem to be subject to a now deeper wound, a spiritual hollowness. The historical setting of the <i>The Green Knight</i>  is thus ideal to go and examine the birth of urban issue at its root: comfort. My point is the following: the “domination of nature” through agriculture ensures a physical sustenance to humans – but deprives them of the spiritual sustenance of the hunting-gathering activity. Nature  is, temporarily, tamed. And yet something greater was at play in our battle, we come to understand that we needed the adversary we vanquished for the challenge it offered us.</p>

<p>The movie opens with a shot of cattle, anchoring the movie in the technological change that is at the root of Gawain’s struggle. Hunting as a prime source of food has disappeared, and with it a great opportunity for youths to show their valour to the community.  Gawain’s progression cannot either occur through war since the Saxons have been vanquished by the warriors. The absence of quest engenders idleness, a void, which vice is quick to occupy.</p>

<p>Fortunately the Green Knight is summoned, and offers a quest – a Game – which can save Gawain. The Game consists of a series of challenges, which, interestingly, become more and more internal. The first challenge is a beheading, but the fourth one is a hidden one: the testing of one’s virtue in the private, resting realm. The ultimate test is the severing of the maternal bond, and the acceptance of death.</p>

<p>What is fascinating in Gawain’s story is how he is saved by a Game. Isn’t it surprising that a mere Game could make him holy? And yet that is what happens. To me, this hints at something interesting. We undertake Games when boredom strikes, think a too-long Sunday afternoon. As such, the Game can become a cure to our boredom. They are, in a way, an artificial challenge, a place to expand the surplus of energy that results from having relinquished a great part of our survival work to technology. I thus argue that modern boredom can be cured by the invention of Games, which offer an opportunity to prove one’s worth. This becomes the way of transcending the curse associated with the blessing of technology. The redeeming quality of the Game is in the fact that we can choose to undertake it, where survival is forced. It is in this new choice of the allocation of our energy that we find the exertion of freedom. What emerges, in the choice to put our life “back on the table”, is a splendid disregard of death, a playfulness akin to the one of the Lord who actualises his knighthood daily in the pursuit of “Game”. In the end, all seems to be contained in the “Green”: to accept death is to blossom.</p>
      

      
   <h1><center>Have a Nice Day (2017)</center></h1>
<center><i><p>or how to put ideology in perspective without destroying everything (an emanation of metamodernism)</p></i></center>


<p>In an absurd succession of events, motley people struggle for a bag of money that would finance their respective dream.</p>

<p>Black humour is a style of comedy that finds the funny side in dark subjects like death and tragedy, through twisted, ironic, or unconventional perspectives, often challenging societal norms and expectations. Under the influence of postmodernism, black humour has become more present in cultural life,  and also, perhaps more cynical, generating thought provoking but often bleak outlooks of life.* <br>
I argue that <em>Have a nice day</em> offers a new take on the genre, as it shows that black humour is not confined to cynicism: it can retain the incisiveness of scepticism, while being infused with hope and compassion.</p>

<p>To support my point, I will start by showing that the movie pertains to black comedy through irony and scepticism(<em>i</em>). Afterwards, I will show how elements of hope and compassion are introduced through a humanisation of characters(<em>ii</em>). Finally, I analyse the painting studio scene to show how cynicism is literally beaten up to pave the way for metamodernism (<em>iii</em>).</p>

<b>(i) Elements of postmodern black humour</b>
<p><em>Have a nice day</em> is in some ways reminiscent of the movie <em>Fargo</em> (1996). Non-heroic characters violently struggle for money in an unremarkable town, in a minor but peculiar succession of events. The film is characterised by absurdism, notably regarding how characters come to be involved in the imbroglio, or what happens to them (for instance being electrocuted and left for dead while hammering a speed camera). Irony is also present: the protagonist, though spending most of the movie time unconscious (at least three knockouts!), is weirdly carried around to end up seizing the prize.<br>
Thirdly, ideologies are presented with a sceptic eye. As an undercurrent, the whole massacre happens because Xiao Zhang's girlfriend wanted facial surgery in the first place - a practice that has recently been booming through social media in China. They are also criticised through formal depiction: Shangri-La (the young couple's dream) is shown with propaganda imagery.<br></p
<p>Though ideologies are challenged, it is precisely because they are expressed that characters are humanised, and where <em>Have a nice day</em> goes beyond <em>Fargo</em>'s postmodernism (correct me if I am wrong about this though). Though most end up dying, there is will to live in these souls that makes it sound like something could be built.</p>

<b>(ii) Postmodernism is subverted by character complexification and humanisation</b>
<p>There is a sizable amount of small talk in <em>Have a nice day</em>. These conversations are often irrelevant to the progression of the plot, but it is precisely in these moments that characters can express their will to live, dreams or ways of coping with the question of existence. We may not always agree with what they believe in or worship, but something of a human communion happens when characters express their dreams. As an example, Uncle Liu is a mafia kingpin but wants to help brother Biao build a garden. Xiao Zhang robs a man at knife point, but wants to honour his mother and has wisdom quotes on the walls of his room. Mr Skinny is a Hitman, but does so to pay studies in the US for his daughter. Humanisation also happens simply by developing the relationships between the characters, showing how they might be friendly to each other, care for an aunt or a cousin or their wife. The point being that these characters are shown as being neither good nor bad, guilty of crimes certainly, but not inherently evil. They are probably like their faces: neither beautiful nor ugly - unique. The only soulless characters that might be present in the movie are the ones who seek money for itself and not as a means.<br>
As a conclusion, crime is seen as a function of poverty or of corrupted ideology, but not as a function of the people. This means that in other conditions, they would not participate in crime, which is perhaps untrue of <em>Fargo</em>’s characters.<br> </p>
<p>The destructive nature of postmodernism is countered here, but not without grudges. Through the study of the painting studio scene, I will show how disappointment in the betrayal of postmodernism is cured through cathartic metaphoric violence.</p>

<b>(iii) Yuan Jun beaten up: a cathartic castigation of postmodernism</b>
<p>One of the first scenes of <em>Have a nice day</em> shows uncle Liu before a background of ugly smiling faces (including a suicidal one). He is talking to Yuan Jun, an old friend who slept with his wife behind his back. Through background perspective, we are led to think that we are in Uncle Liu's lair, and that in some way he adheres to the art behind him. In a clever reversal of situation, we then understand that this imagery was created by Yuan Jun (we are caught misjudging). The situation is illuminated: Yuan Jun is an incarnation of postmodernism, seeing humans as either "fools or idiots". In contrast, Uncle Liu is perhaps an avatar of the director himself, heavily disappointed in a man that he greeted in his own bed to protect him from the cold. In a catharsis remindful of Tarantino, postmodernism is stripped naked, baring the seediness of its essence - which is irrespective of any institution, including friendship.<br></p>
<p>In the end, it is all about faces. <br>
Yuan Jun is a fauvist, deforming the faces of humans to ugliness through his ideology - a dangerous artist. In contrast, modernity orders an idealism: the one of faces conforming to beauty standards - which requires another deformation, the one that Xiao Zhang's girlfriend endures. Emerging from this dialogue, metamodernism comes up to accept different faces, plain faces without judgement, as the ones of the characters in this story.</p>
<p>From the Resurrection announced by Tolstoï before the film emerges a new spring. Numerologically, room 301 perhaps echoes that movement. The trinity, defeated, is replaced by a terrifying void, which in time makes way for a new start or an attempt at universality. The same movement can be found in the English title of the movie - the traditional first meaning is subverted by irony (probably not a good day for the characters), but ultimately saved by a meta-reading of the collocation as addressed to the spectator itself: "Be well, traveler!"</p>
