      "Yaboube" is to me the epitome of freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Tarpeian rock is close to the Capitol.
      </p>
      <p>
      The notes need not be in tune: what is moving in live music, is not so much the technical beauty
      as the courage of the endeavour. By doing it, the person is showing it is possible.
      </p>
      <p>
      <!--Questions not answers. We merely remove clouds from our vision.-->
      </p>
      <p>
      <!--We wear our misdeeds on our face.-->

      <!--Humanity does progress.-->

      <p>
      <!--Psychological well being is the strongest predictor of job performance, not job satisfaction.-->
      </p>
      <p>
      To properly teach: make clear the value enabled by the knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
      Emotion is the prime memory. We avoid or seek based on that.
      <!--Trust is earned in drops, lost in buckets.-->
      </p>
      <p>
      Absence of dialogue or perspective is the surest way to powerful mistakes of judgement.
      A fruitful imagination will easily charm the mind in filling the voids of experience.
      </p>
      <p>
      <!--Writing is thinking.-->
      </p>
      <p>
      <!--First actions: the real moment of courage, the rest is repetition.-->
      </p>
      <p>
      The relationship between reflexion and experience: the collection of information and its digestion.

      <p>
      <!--When hesitating between two options, status quo breaking is advised.-->
      </p>
      <p>
      <!--Happiness is not wanting to be doing something else than what you are doing right now.-->
      </p>
      <p>
      Articulation is a substitute for action? To articulate is to able to witness, to integrate
      and to understand. Why do we have the illusion that thinking is enough? To project in reality
      what was in the mind is to see in dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
      It is when we understand that we do not understand that our judgement is the fairest.
      In contrary, the mind is weakest when it is under the spell of a new theory.

      <p>
      <!--Isn't excommunication worse than death?-->
      </p>
      <p>
      Language evolution as a barrier to entry for some old books. Just how important
      are inital idea sources?
      </p>
      <p>
      Cooking and the combination of opposites. The strong is best coupled with the mild.
      (Cheese and bread)
      The soft with the crunchy. The dry with the oily. Slacking with work.

      <p>
      <!--Books call books. Beauty beckons beauty.-->

      <p>
      Philosophy as therapy, more than discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
      When we can tie different elements logically, then we move to comprehension from simply knowing.
      We make bundles, which can be recreated from one piece only afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
      It is because personal vision is so limited that collective intelligence is the way to truth.

      <!--Self-perceived social ability is the prophecy that comes to be realized in social interactions.
      It fluctuates in level with social exposure/practice.-->

      The promise of an event or a meeting already affects the body and the mind, which anticipate.
      As I put on my exercise outfit, my muscles are already jumping with joy, like the dog
      who has been summoned for his walk. Likewise, isolation is broken by the promise of a social event.
      In the same idea, the virtues of an event have a lingering presence that accompany us for some time,
      like traces of a scent.

      The internet is a pharmakon with an exponent. Visualize the evil man destroyed
      by too powerful a weapon.

      Anxiety is the vertigo of freedom.
      </p>

      Data is what is missing to Bacon's spider, she is spinning an algorithm on lacking data.
      The ant has plenty of data, but does not make anything of it. The ant is a martyr to society,
      the spider is a solitary predator. <!--It has two legs more. Not many spiders can live in the
      same ecosystem: they would be lacking prey. For bees I do not know what to make of the metaphor,
      as there are forager bees that bring the pollen, and hive bees who digest the honey and heat it to
      decrease its water concentration.-->
      </p>
      <p>
      The danger of ideas and words is that they have no relief. Relief is perceived in the experience
      of reality. But before that, any idea is as good as another.
      </p>

      <!--They say the butcher sublimes a killing will in his work. What does the creator sublimes?
      A demiurgic arrogance?-->
      </p>

      'Errare humanum est', errors are human, but more than that, isn't Everything we do an error?
      <!--'Errors are almost always sacred' says Dali.-->

      There is no Man, but a plurality of men. (From H.Arendt in <em>Responsability and judgement</em>)

      For the musical artist, a room of one's own (the material condition of his spiritual development)
      is soundproof walls.
      </p>
      <p>
      What is near is visited, what is far is not visited. Of the immense value of having nature 
      near your house, or a friend or a fine shop.
      </p>
      <p>
      Do we need to periodically
      go to the desert to perceive the value of our home? Bjork throws objects off a cliff
      in <em>Hyperballad</em>, Jesus isolates. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Can we keep in our mind at the same time our good and evil dimension? Can we continually
      perceive our duality? <!--Being able to not be under the illusion that we are completely good
      would bring us closer to a truthful behaviour.-->
      </p>
      <p>
      I see a high proximity between the philosopher and the artist. Both are thinkers, but they are
      concerned with truth at different stages. I would say the artist is anterior to the philosopher,
      but do correct me if I am wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
      The song <em>Them Heavy People</em> by Kate Bush is a splendid description of 
      the social redemption/return of the secluded artist. The other, a threat, a blessing!

      Ivan Illitch chose a wife that was both a joy to him and to society (at least in the beginning).

      The true bottleneck and vacillation of life is the will to live, which seems to have as non-unique
      condition the "other" as the witness of the dignity of our story. 
      In this regard, "a community of one's own" could be seen as a necessity for mental stability.
      <br />
      As Camus said, the only question that exists is the one of suicide. I agree and add:
      We can be dead spiritually even though we are physically alive.
      This can happen wittingly or unwittingly. To be a living-dead is to refuse
      to live and to refuse suicide, that is to be in limbo.
      That state solidifies with time, but has liquidity.
      </p>
      <p>
      For book search, physical tasting of a limited curated list of random options seems vastly superior to any sort of conceptual approach.
      Randomness is suitable as it makes it possible to find what we were not looking for. Ordering
      references is soulless. Meeting with an object is deliciously contingent.

      The hiking experience is useful as a metaphor of work.

      Video gaming is working in a coherent world. It is a potential substitute
      product for the decrease in work required by employment due to the advancement
      of technology in our incoherent world, hence its growth?
      It is a sort of womb-like coherent copium.

      Experience is the highest source of knowledge.

      Virginia Woolf thought: "Everything that I might write,
       Mr. Joyce is probably doing it better right now."

      "Brusquement, mon travail en restait là; je me rappelai l'incapacité où je m'étais trouvé de fixer
      mon esprit, ce matin d'il y avait à peine un mois, et avec quel plaisir je m'étais interrompu pour aller
      recevoir la Daily Chronicle des mains du petit porteur de journaux."
      From <em>La Guerre des mondes</em> - HG Wells

      I define the following categories of how we spend our time:
      <ul>
        <li>Employment (public constraint)</li>
        <li>Personal work (private constraint)</li>
        <li>Social leasure (public freedom)</li>
        <li>Spite (private freedom)</li>
      </ul> 
      </p>
      <p>

      It is said that four items is what the mind can hold in RAM at a time. This is a maximum.
      Three is suitable as we have one space left in case we need it,
      just as we have two kidneys for security.

      The place of exposition matters: it contaminates the opus.

      The Greeks valued the power of the spoken word, and it was their main method of communication 
      and storytelling. Bahn and Bahn write, "To Greeks the spoken word was a living thing and infinitely
      preferable to the dead symbols of a written language." Socrates himself believed that once
      something has been written down, it lost its ability for change and growth. For these reasons,
      among many others, oral storytelling flourished in Greece. (from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_ancient_Greece)

      A circular running track is terrifyingly infinite. A linear quest is comforting. Deadlines... 
      thank God there is an end! The reassuring presence of the ending. To live towards death, or
      to live towards the end of such event in our life. I live toward the end of that run, or toward
      the end of that party. When I say "I will go soon", everybody is reassured and infused with new life:
      this moment acquires the value of rarity.
