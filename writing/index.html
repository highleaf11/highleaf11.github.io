      <h2>How not to choose a book to read (a case against delayed digital necessity)</h2>
      <p>
1.	Hear about a book
a.	From a thrilled commentary in the internet or in life
b.	In another book
c.	From a list on the internet
2.	Do not sample the book and order it
3.	Wait for the book to arrive
4.	Start reading it
5.	Keep reading it even if unliked because of sunk cost fallacy and lack of other options
6.	After some time, dismiss reading altogether as a boring activity
7.	After some time, having forgotten what happened, repeat the first steps with excitement
      </p>

      <h2>How to choose a book to read (a case for immediate physical randomness)</h2>
      <p>
1.	Go to place containing books (library, book seller, house)
2.	Look at the titles and authors and select some that seem interesting
3.	For these selected books, read the summary and the first paragraphs
4.	Take the first one to three books that seem good enough
5.	Go somewhere and read them or stop reading if they disappoint
6.	Repeat

<h3>How to choose a book to read (a case for immediate physical randomness)</h3>
      <p>
1.	It protects you from internal biases that may reduce your field of possibility, and exposes you to things you did not know you could be enjoying
2.	It offers testability of many different options
3.	It offers limitation in selection which accelerates choice
4.	It gives you immediate access to the content, so that you can ride your emotion as it is present
5.	Most importantly it gives an emotional and historical dimension to the meeting with the book. It fills you with the illusion of uniqueness and destiny, and with an energy to read the book.

      In the end the true bottleneck is probably not the quality of the book in itself, but rather your motivation, mood or posture in approaching it. 
      Physicality and movement, effort, give the book a story, infuse the object with life. Perhaps it is because we could tell a story to someone about how we came to acquire the book that we enjoy reading it.
      We do not want to maximize learning. We want to enjoy a fine moment.
