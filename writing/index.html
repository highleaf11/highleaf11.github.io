      The true bottleneck and vacillation of life is the will to live, which seems to be brought by the "other" as the witness of the dignity of our story.
      As Camus said, the only question that exists is the one of suicide. I agree and add: We can be dead spiritually even though we are physically alive. This can happen wittingly or unwittingly. To be a living-dead is 
      to refuse to live and to refuse suicide, that is to be in limbo. That state solidifies with time, but has liquidity.
