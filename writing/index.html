<h1><center>The Green Knight (2021) - David Lowery</center></h1>
 
<p style="text-indent:30px;"><i>The Green Knight</i> is a most interesting movie as it illustrates the question of the access to knighthood in times of abundance.
  This is a particularly compelling question as I find that it resonates with our current times: Western modern societies have indeed gathered countless resources, 
  and yet seem to be subject to a now deeper wound, a spiritual hollowness. The historical setting of the <i>The Green Knight</i>  is thus ideal to go and examine the 
  birth of urban issue at its root: comfort.<br> My point is the following: the “domination of nature” through agriculture ensures a physical sustenance to humans – but deprives
  them of the spiritual sustenance of the hunting-gathering activity. Nature  is, temporarily, tamed. And yet it appears that something greater was at play in our battle, we come to
  understand that we needed the adversary we vanquished for the challenge it offered us.</p>

<p>The movie opens with a shot of cattle, anchoring the movie in the technological change that is at the root of Gawain’s struggle. Hunting as a prime source of food
  has disappeared, and with it a great opportunity for youths to show their valour to the community.  Gawain’s progression cannot either occur through war since the 
  Saxons have been vanquished by the warriors. The absence of quest engenders idleness, a void, which vice is quick to occupy.</p>

<p>Fortunately the Green Knight is summoned, and offers a quest – a Game – which can save Gawain. The Game consists of a series of challenges, 
  which, interestingly, become more and more internal. The first challenge is a beheading, but the fourth one is a hidden one: the testing of one’s virtue
  in the private, resting realm. The ultimate test is the severing of the maternal bond, and the acceptance of death.</p>

<p>What is fascinating in Gawain’s story is how he is saved by a Game. Isn’t it surprising that a mere Game could make him holy? And yet that is
  what happens. To me, this hints at something interesting. We undertake Games when boredom strikes, on an endless sunday afternoon for instance.
  As such, Games can become a cure to our boredom. They are, in a way, an artificial challenge, a place to expand the surplus of energy that
  results from having relinquished a great part of our survival work to technology. I thus argue that modern boredom can be cured by the invention 
  of Games, which offer an opportunity to prove one’s worth. This becomes the way of transcending the curse associated with the blessing of technology.
  The redeeming quality of the Game is in the fact that we can choose to undertake it, where survival is forced. It is in this new choice of the allocation
  of our energy that we find the exertion of freedom. What emerges, in the choice to put our life “back on the table”, is a splendid disregard of death,
  a playfulness akin to the one of the Lord who actualises his knighthood daily in the pursuit of “Game”. In the end, all seems to be contained in the
  “Green”: to accept death is to blossom.</p>
