      Which can be wholly seen in reality.

      <strong>Ideology:</strong> 
      For Karl Marx, ideology is a series of discourses that push false ideas on people.
      When people buy into these false ideas, they develop a “false consciousness” about the world, how it works, and their place in it.
      According to Marx, without ideology, no society could function for very long. (From https://bigthink.com/the-present/slavoj-zizek-ideology/)
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Bullshit:</strong> 
      Disregard for truth seeking endeavours, by uttering statements that may or may not be true. Differs from lying as it avoids truth seeking instead of telling lies. (From Harry Frankfurt, <em>On Bullshit</em>)
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>WYSIATI:</strong> 
      What you see is all there is. Cognitive bias described by Daniel Khaneman. Our tendency to make judgements based on the information that is available to us, with unwitting obliviousness to what we may not know.
      In a way, it is our mind's drive for coherence that propels it to draw conclusions regardless of the quality of data it has at disposal.
